# ASCII-ART-WEB

## Objectives

_**ASCII ART WEB**_ consists in creating and running a server for outputting the text in a graphic representation of ASCII using our last project, _**ASCII ART**_ on a website.

## How to use the program ?

In order to use our program, you have to type the following on your command prompt `go run main.go`. Afterwards, the server will start and you will be invited to click on the link below that will take you to the website.

```
PS C:\VSCODEProjet\Ytrack\B1\ASCII-ART-WEB\ascii-art-web> go run main.go
Starting server at port 8080
Go on http://127.0.0.1:8080

To shutdown the server and exit the code hit "crtl+C"
```

Once you are on the website, you will be able to :
- Type your text ;
- Choose a font-style between Standard, Shadow and Thinkertoy ;
- Customize the colors of the text and the background ;
- Adjust the font size of the text.

# ASCII-ART-WEB-DOCKERIZE

## Objectives

The main goal of the subproject _**DOCKERIZE**_ is to create a Dockerfile (== an executable that contains the files and the dependencies of a program.), one image and one container

## How to do a docker ?

You have to create a Dockerfile which contains the following :

```docker
# The base go-image
FROM golang:1.15.6
 
# Create a directory for the app
RUN mkdir /ascii-web-docker
 
# Copy all files from the current directory to the app directory
COPY . /ascii-web-docker
 
# Set working directory
WORKDIR /ascii-web-docker
 
# Run command as described:
# go build will build an executable file named server in the current directory
RUN go build -o server . 
 
# Run the server executable
CMD [ "/ascii-web-docker/server" ]
```


Afterwards, in order to run the docker in the command prompt:

You have to build the program with the command :

```cmd
docker build -t ascii-web-docker .
```

Then, run it with the command :

```cmd
docker run -it --rm -p 8081:8080 ascii-web-docker
```
